# TP Notes

This repository contains my personal notes for the course **Tecnología de la Programación**, part of the **2nd year of the Mathematics degree at the University of Murcia** (academic year 2025–2026).  

It is designed as a structured collection of theory, practice, and my own class notes, so that all the relevant material for the subject is centralized in one place.

## Repository structure

- **`lectures/`** – Practical sessions and exercises from the course. Each folder inside corresponds to a different session and contains the worked examples, implementations, and problem-solving strategies.  
- **`theory/`** – Theoretical content and reference material. This section summarizes the main concepts explained in class and includes additional clarifications where necessary.  
- **`notes.docs`** – Main document that brings everything together. It contains my in-class notes, summaries of key ideas, and the most important points from exercises and problem sets.

## Purpose and usage

The repository is mainly for my personal study, but it can also be useful for other students taking the course. By keeping theory and practice separated, and combining them with my own notes, the goal is to make revision and exam preparation more efficient.  

Feel free to explore the materials, compare them with your own notes, or adapt the structure if you find it useful for your studies.
